# Phase 4 Retired Paths Archive
Date: 2026-02-08

This folder stores paths retired during Phase 4 cleanup.

## Contents
1. `ep2` (empty legacy episode slot)
2. `av_seedgen_python (2)` (duplicate of baseline generator)
3. `av_seedgen_python_profiles (2)` (duplicate of profiles generator)

## Why archive instead of delete
Direct delete was blocked by environment policy during cleanup execution.
Paths were moved here as a safe, reversible retirement step.

## Removal policy
Keep read-only through compatibility review date: 2026-03-08.
If no rollback requests exist at review time, this archive can be removed.
