# Episodes (Canonical Paths)

Use content-slug folders for all current and new episodes.

## Active episodes
1. `episodes/welcome_to_bytecast` (`EP-001`)
2. `episodes/aerovista_7_division_overview` (`EP-002`)

## Policy
- New episodes must use: `episodes/<content_slug>/`
- Do not create new numeric `epN` folders.
- Legacy numeric paths are temporary wrappers only.

## Registry
See `.CODEX/episode_registry.json` for authoritative mapping and status.
