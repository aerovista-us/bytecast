# Lift Lab — First Tasks (Starter Board)

Pick one. Keep it small. Ship it.

## Track A — Scout (Testing + QA)
1. Run the ByteCast page on **mobile** and list any layout bugs (screenshots).
2. Test keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab) and report any traps.
3. Try “offline mode” (turn off Wi‑Fi) and confirm what breaks; write a short report.
4. Verify audio controls work in Chrome + Edge + Safari (if possible).
5. Create a “Device Matrix” table of what you tested (device, OS, browser, result).

## Track B — Scribe (Docs + Tutorials)
6. Add screenshots to `docs/LiftLab_Playbook.md` sections (optional images folder).
7. Write a “How to submit a bug report” guide in `docs/howto_bug_reports.md`.
8. Create a glossary in `docs/glossary.md` (PR, issue, repro, commit, branch).
9. Improve wording in `site/index.html` (make onboarding clearer).
10. Convert one repeated explanation into a reusable snippet in `docs/snippets.md`.

## Track C — Designer (UX + Accessibility)
11. Audit contrast for buttons/links; list improvements.
12. Suggest 3 improvements to the “Missions” UI (annotated screenshot).
13. Create a simple layout alternative for the “Slides” panel (wireframe).
14. Add ARIA labels to player controls (if you’re comfortable editing HTML).
15. Propose a reduced-motion mode (what should stop animating).

## Track D — Builder (Coding Ramp)
16. Add a new mission card via JSON (`content/missions.json`) and render it.
17. Add a theme switch option (keep default dark neon).
18. Add a “copy link” button for a mission.
19. Add a simple “progress” state that marks missions as done in localStorage.
20. Add a new slide to the slideshow via JSON (`content/slides.json`).

## Bonus (Any Track)
21. Write 5 “good first issue” stubs for other AeroVista repos you love.
22. Turn one repeated support answer into a mini tutorial.
23. Make a 30s screen recording of how to navigate the ByteCast.
24. Create a short “Welcome” blurb for newcomers (friendly + clear).
25. Improve loading/performance notes in `docs/performance_notes.md`.
