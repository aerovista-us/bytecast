# AeroVista Lift Lab — Playbook (v1)
_Last updated: 2026-02-07_

Lift Lab is the AeroVista on-ramp for people who want to contribute **now**—even if they can’t code (yet)—and a runway that helps them become confident builders by shipping small, real work.

## The 4 Tracks
### Track A — Scout (Testing + QA)
**You help by:** finding bugs, writing great repro steps, recording short clips, verifying fixes.  
**You learn:** debugging habits, clear communication, product intuition.

### Track B — Scribe (Docs + Tutorials)
**You help by:** improving onboarding docs, adding screenshots, creating “how-to” guides, updating glossaries.  
**You learn:** systems thinking, technical writing, tool fluency.

### Track C — Designer (UX + Accessibility)
**You help by:** identifying confusing flows, proposing UI improvements, checking accessibility, creating simple mockups.  
**You learn:** usability patterns, a11y basics, product polish.

### Track D — Builder (Coding Ramp)
**You help by:** JSON edits → Tailwind tweaks → simple React components → bug fixes.  
**You learn:** Git, PR workflow, React/Tailwind fundamentals, “ship small” craft.

## The Level Ladder (Ship to Level Up)
- **L0 — Observer:** reads the playbook, joins chat/discussions, picks a track.
- **L1 — Contributor:** submits 1 high-quality bug report OR a docs PR.
- **L2 — Shipper:** completes 3 “Starter Board” tasks (any track).
- **L3 — Builder:** merges a code PR (UI tweak, JSON-driven feature, small fix).
- **L4 — Specialist:** owns a page/module, helps review newcomers.

## Your First Mission (Pick ONE)
1) **Bug report** using the template (best first step for Scouts)  
2) **Docs improvement PR** (best first step for Scribes)  
3) **UX feedback** with annotated screenshots (best first step for Designers)  
4) **JSON-only task** (best first step for Builders)

## How We Work (Simple Loop)
1) Pick a task from **FIRST_TASKS.md** (or issues labeled `good-first-issue`, `no-code`, `docs`, `testing`, `json-only`, `ui-only`)  
2) Follow the task checklist (what “done” means)  
3) Submit PR or issue  
4) Get feedback (we use the same rubric every time)  
5) Merge + log into the **Contributor Ledger**

## How to Ask for Help (Fast Answers)
When you post a question, include:
- What you’re trying to do
- What you expected
- What happened instead
- Screenshot or copy/paste error text
- Your device/browser (if UI)

## Quality Rules (So Everyone Wins)
- **Small PRs** are preferred (aim for < 50 lines when possible).
- If something is unclear, that’s a docs bug—**we fix the docs/task**, not the person.
- No vague feedback. We give **actionable** notes and a “next step.”

## Suggested Weekly Rhythm (Optional)
- **1 hour**: Office hours / live Q&A
- **15 min**: Review new issues in Starter Board
- **30 min**: Merge party (help newcomers land their first PR)

## Maintainers: How to Keep It Healthy
- Keep `FIRST_TASKS.md` fresh
- Tag issues carefully
- Reply fast to first-time PRs
- Use the PR checklist so feedback feels consistent
