## Runtime target

## Host tone
Energetic, welcoming, clear. Make it obvious: **you can help even if you can’t code.**

## Outline
### 1) Cold open (0:00–0:30)
- “If you want to be part of AeroVista but don’t code yet — you’re still needed.”

### 2) What Lift Lab is (0:30–2:00)
- Four tracks: Scout (testing), Scribe (docs), Designer (UX), Builder (coding ramp)
- “Pick the one that matches how your brain works today.”

### 3) Your first mission (2:00–4:00)

  - Gold-tier bug report
  - Docs improvement PR
  - UX feedback with annotated screenshot
  - JSON-only change

### 4) How leveling works (4:00–6:00)
