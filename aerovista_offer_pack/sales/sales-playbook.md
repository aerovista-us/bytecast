# Sales Playbook (Internal)

## 30-second baseline pitch
We deliver fast, premium, and practical work across web, interactive experiences, audio, training, design, publishing, and aerial media — built to ship quickly now, and scale later without rebuilding.

## Qualification (5 questions)
1) What do you sell, and who’s the buyer?
2) What’s the #1 action you want people to take?
3) What do you already have? (domain/logo/photos/copy)
4) What’s your deadline and why?
5) What’s your “good outcome” in one sentence?

## Objection handlers (short)
- “I can do it myself”: You can — you’re buying time, polish, and a future-proof base.
- “Too expensive”: Let’s match scope to your outcome; we can launch small and expand.
- “Need it ASAP”: If assets are ready, we can move fast. Otherwise we start with a sprint.
- “Not sure what I need”: We’ll recommend the smallest package that gets you a win.

## Close pattern (simple)
- Confirm outcome → choose package → confirm assets → confirm timeline → collect deposit → send intake.

## Follow-up templates
### Follow-up (same day)
Subject: AeroVista — next step + intake
Body: Here’s the intake form. Once we have assets and the deposit, we schedule immediately and start the sprint.

### Follow-up (48 hours)
Subject: Quick check-in
Body: Want to proceed with the package we discussed or adjust scope? Either way I can keep momentum moving.
