# AeroVista — 7-Division Bread & Butter Offer Pack (Training Bundle)

**Build date:** 2026-02-07

This bundle is a **sales + delivery** pack for AeroVista’s “bread & butter” offers:
- easy to explain
- easy to fulfill
- high perceived value
- clean upsell paths

## What’s inside
- `offer-pack.md` — master offer menu (all 7 divisions + bundles + fulfillment rules)
- `one-pager.md` — client-ready offer menu (tight + premium)
- `pricing-grid.md` — Good / Better / Best anchors per division + bundle anchors
- `intake/` — standard intake form + asset checklist
- `sales/` — scripts, qualification, objections, follow-up templates
- `delivery/` — fulfillment SOP + QA checklists
- `divisions/` — per-division “offer cards” + scoping boundaries + handoff specs

## How to use (internal)
1. Sales opens `one-pager.md` during calls (talk track).
2. After fit-check, share a trimmed version of `one-pager.md` or paste from `offer-pack.md`.
3. Once a package is chosen, send the client `intake/client-intake-form.md`.
4. Delivery follows `delivery/fulfillment-sop.md` + the matching division offer card.

## Conventions
- **Two revision rounds** included unless stated otherwise.
- **50% deposit** to schedule; remainder on delivery (or milestone-based for larger scopes).
- Add-ons and exclusions are explicit to protect margin.
